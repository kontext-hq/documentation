# Product Overview

About Kontext and how to get started

## What is Kontext?

Kontext enables you to integrate app analytics and marketing. 

Our platform helps you increase user engagement in three ways: 

- You can track actions users are taking in your app to analyze how people use your product. 
- You can segment users based on their actions and run targeted campaigns to these segments. 
- You can analyze each of your campaigns to understand their impact on user engagement and your business metrics.

## Platform Features

There are five parts of the Kontext platform: 

- **EASY TO USE** - Implementing reliable interfaces to the GCM/FCM (Google), APNS (Apple), and the Web Push protocols is difficult. There are open source projects to do it, but even the best ones break when message quantity begins to exceed 500,000 at a time.
- **SDKs** that let you track users’ actions within your mobile apps and websites. Our SDKs also enable you to personalize your app by giving you access to user profile data.
- **DASHBOARD** where you can segment your users based on their actions, run targeted campaigns to these segments, and analyze each campaign’s performance. 
- **ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY** - Kontext provides marketing tools including A/B testing, segment targeting, variable-substitution, localization, drip marketing, and conversion tracking.
- **WEBHOOKS** that let you trigger workflows in your backend systems as soon as qualifying events occur.

## Core Concepts

Users, events, segments, campaigns, and reports are central to the Kontext experience, so it is important to understand each one's role. 

- **Users:** After you integrate the Kontext SDK, a user profile will be created for each person who launches your app or visits your website. The Kontext user profile has a set of default fields, such as device and location. You can also extend the default user profile data model by adding custom fields that are specific to your business.
- **Events:** The Kontext SDK lets you track what actions users perform in your app or website, such as a user viewing a product, listening to a song, or making a purchase. Events are associated with a user profile.
- **Segments:** Kontext enables you to create segments, which are a group of users whose behaviors, activities, or user profile properties meet a set of criteria you’ve defined. Once you’ve identified segments of interest, you can save them, target them with a campaign, and then analyze them over time. 
- **Campaigns:** Kontext campaigns enable you to communicate with your users at scale. Kontext offers 3 different messaging channels to reach your users with the right message at the right time.
- **Reports:** Kontext lets you build reports to understand the impact of your campaigns on your users. You can use these reports to analyze your user engagement and guide product decisions.
