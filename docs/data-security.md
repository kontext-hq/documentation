# Security Overview

Protecting customer data is always a priority at Kontext. Our success as a business relies on the security of customer data stored with us. 

As a company, we use the Kontext platform ourselves for user analytics and engagement. This document mentions steps we take to ensure security, privacy and confidentiality of customer data.

## Inflight Incoming Data Security

All data collection endpoints support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 encryption protocols with SHA256 with RSA signature algorithm. This allows devices with varied support to access our collection/incoming endpoints while providing the TLS 1.2 to devices that support it.

We maintain a small list of known URLs where we respond to HTTPS requests. All requests to unknown URLs, or requests that don’t match our expected data format are logged and silently dropped.

The operation team reviews all dropped requests periodically.

## Dashboard Data Security

The Dashboard and API endpoints support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 encryption protocols with SHA256 with RSA signature algorithm. Outdated SSL protocols are not supported. We allow dashboard access through modern secure browsers. Developers are required to use updated libraries to access our API endpoints.

## Incoming Request Logging

All incoming requests are logged and stored on persistent storage for analysis and audit. Logs are purged periodically based on industry retention best practices.

## Customer Data Security

Customer data is stored in an encoded format optimized for performance, rather than stored in a traditional file system or a database. Data is dispersed across a number of physical and logical volumes for redundancy and expedient access, thereby obfuscating it from tampering

Customers own all rights to their data and can choose to download it via an API or delete it from our systems. Kontext provides role based app­ level access control to customers to manage access to their own data.

Kontext does not share or sell customer data.

## Running Systems

Kontext uses battle tested open source software to power some parts of its application stack. We subscribe to CVE vulnerability data and patch critical vulnerabilities within 24 hours of publication. In addition, we destroy and rebuild nodes that power public facing endpoints every few days. This ensures we don’t have configuration drift in production.

## Data Center Security

Azure Cloud is our hosting provider. They maintain data­centers that are fully compliant with a range of certifications which allow finance, healthcare and government data to be stored in their data­centers. A full list of compliance and more information along with certification is available at <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/support/legal/subscription-agreement-nov-2014/>.

Shared responsibility with Amazon means we focus on application and data security while physical security is managed by them.

## Team

At Kontext, our engineering and IT teams are experienced and have a know-how of industry best practices on security. Before Kontext, we’ve built and run many heavy traffic sites both on physical as well as virtual infrastructure. We bring many years of operational experience running secure and scalable services.

The security and confidentiality of your data is core to our success as a business and we will continue to be proactive, vigilant and diligent in ensuring its safety.
